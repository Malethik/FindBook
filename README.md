## API Used

The application uses the RapidAPI API to fetch book data. For more information, visit the API documentation: [API Documentation Link](https://rapidapi.com/cinnamon17/api/libros1)

## Development Stages

First, I created a header file to contain the title, ensuring compliance with HTML standards. Then, I built the homepage, which calls the Book component. Inside the Book component, there is an input field that passes data to the query, which is used to perform the fetch operation on the API.

In the options variable, I included the authentication header and specified the request method (in this case, GET). The API configuration is located in the environments folder, and I placed the models in the models folder.
